## Basic requirements or "How to prepare you environemnt"
What do we need to run terraform ? 
* a computer
* the terraform binary
* a text-editor

### Terraform Binary

First of all you need the "terraform" binary on your computer. It's available for mostly any platform and can be downloaded here: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
So please download the appropriate Version for your platform, unzip it and put it in a Directory which is in your $PATH. 

### Text editor 

First of all: Take what ever editor you like. Some of them will be a lot more help than others (like Visual Studio Code) some are just Editors (vim). Both will work
